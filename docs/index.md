## About the RCM

Welcome to the RCM project! This is a new technology designed specifically for React components, aiming to make them more reusable and dynamic. With RCM, you can easily manage and configure React components, enabling a more flexible and scalable approach to building your applications.

The RCM project is created from two apps working together. One app is for the business analyst and the other app is for the software developer to create React components and plugins. Once created, the plugins get uploaded into the business analyst's app, thus customizing your website.
